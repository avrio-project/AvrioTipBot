# Avrio TipBot

### This Should work with Avrio, and any fork that uses 4-decimals

If you like to adjust to other forks that don't use 4-decimals, please change decimal value in `node-mdules/xmr-nodejs` or create a new module for your prefered coin

Or even better, adjust to have it a configurable option and create a PR :)


### Standard Requirements : 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mongodb version 3.6.4 (compatible), other version use is not recommended, but it can work
```sudo apt install mongodb```

Node.js version 8.11.2 (compatible), other version is not recommended, but it can work

```
